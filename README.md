# ninety-nine-scala-problems
Convenient starting point for Phil Gold's [S99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/). Contains skeleton scala code (taken from the S99 snippets) and complete test coverage for all problems.

__Instructions__

Clone it and run
    
    sbt test

You'll see most tests failing. Fill in the missing implementations and make them all pass.

__Notes__

The code is based on Phil's snippets with some minor and a few bigger changes. Some were necessary (e.g. because of a newer Scala version), some added clarity or conciseness.

Uses [Scala 2.11](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.11.7/), [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/),
and [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/).

__Contributions__

Contributions are welcome via GitHub issues or pull requests.

__Solutions__

You'll learn most if you find your own solutions. However, if you need inspiration or want to compare solutions, you're welcome to look at my attempts on the [`solutions`](https://github.com/jayho/ninety-nine-scala-problems/tree/solutions) branch, or at Phil's solutions on his S99 website.
